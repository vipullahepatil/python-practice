Questionnaire:

Do you want to exclusively focus on a technical, non-managerial career?
Yes, I am keen on pursuing a purely technical career path at this stage.

Are you comfortable working with legacy technologies like COBOL or z/OS?
Yes, I am open to working with legacy systems if required.

Do you prefer working on front-end or mobile applications, or do you consider yourself a 100% backend developer?
I primarily specialize in backend development and am comfortable working on backend systems exclusively. If required, I can also contribute to front-end or mobile applications, but my main expertise lies in backend technologies.

If you specialize exclusively in Java (or C#), would you be willing to spend 50% of your time developing in the other language?
Yes, I am flexible and open to working in both Java and C# as needed.
Also, I have experience in Python , Node.js which I can leverage for specific tasks or tooling.

Are you up to date with the latest advancements in your primary language (Java or C#)? Can you name the three most recent LTS releases and highlight the major improvements in each?
Yes.

Java 8: Introduced lambda expressions, Stream API, and the new Date/Time API.

Java 11: Brought features like var for lambda parameters, HTTP client API, and removal of older modules.

Java 17: Added sealed classes, pattern matching for switch (preview), and enhanced performance/stability.

Java 21 (latest LTS): Introduces virtual threads (Project Loom), pattern matching improvements, and record patterns.

What is your motivation for applying for this specific role?
The role aligns well with my experience in both Java and C#, and Iâ€™m excited about the opportunity to work on cross-language development, especially with custom tooling and parser-related tasks. The technical depth and scope of this role are appealing to me.

What is the most technically challenging task you have ever worked on?
One of the most technically challenging task I worked on Python-based project where i dont have much experience. but i am quick learner so I was able to quickly adapt and complete the project successfully. 


Please let me know if any additional information is required.

Looking forward to the next steps.
